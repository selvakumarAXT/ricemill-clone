## üìù Form Fields

### Required Fields

## üßÆ Calculation Logic

### Item Total Calculation
```
Taxable Amount = (Quantity √ó Price) - Item Discount
IGST Amount = Taxable Amount √ó IGST Rate (if percentage)
Item Total = Taxable Amount + IGST Amount + CESS
```

### Document Total Calculation
```
Subtotal = Sum of all item totals
Document Discount = Fixed amount or (Subtotal √ó Discount Rate)
TCS Amount = Fixed amount or (Subtotal √ó TCS Rate)
Grand Total = Subtotal - Document Discount + TCS Amount
Final Total = Round(Grand Total) if round-off enabled
```
